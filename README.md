## Overview
The project looks at data available on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) and The Movie Database (TMDB) to determine what makes a commercially successful movie in the United States. Our goals for this project are as follows:
1. Extract data from IMDB and TMDB using their API.
2. Transform and load the data into a SQL database
3. Conduct hypothesis testing to determine what features determine financial success.

## Business Problem 
A fictional customer is the newly appointed head of a production company. They want their first movie as the head of their company to be a major success and want to use data to optimize their movie and increase the likelihood of success. Our customer wants their first major release to be a commercial success. Therefore, we will measure success for this project in terms of the profitability of the movie (vice popularity, or awards).

## Data
### Data Sources
The data for this project comes from two separate sources. These datasets were extracted, transformed, and loaded into a MySQL database for analysis as part of this project. Our data sources are as follows:
- [IMDB's Publically Available Data](https://datasets.imdbws.com/): IMDB provides basic information and statistics on movies within their databasefrom which we can pull a majority of the information needed for our analysis. 
- [TMDB Movie Data](https://www.themoviedb.org/): Accessed through the [tmdbsimple](https://github.com/celiao/tmdbsimple) API package we were able to augment the data available on IMDB with financial information (budget, revenue) and MPAA rating.

The original dataset has been stored in this repository and can be found [here](https://github.com/msmccann10/PP-movie-database-and-analysis/tree/main/data).The data was subsequently turned into a MySQL database for easier access and analysis.

### Data Dictionary
We used the following features from the IMDB and TMDB databases for ouranalysis. 

|Feature|Description|Source|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|genre_name|the genres associated with the title|IMDB Database|string|
|runtimeMinutes|primary runtime of the title, in minutes|IMDB Database|numeric|
|averageRating|weighted average of all the individual user ratings|IMDB Database|numeric|
|numVotes|number of votes the title has received|IMDB Database|numeric|
|status|status of the film in the database (eg: released)|TMDB API|string|
|certification|MPAA rating for the movie (eg: PG-13)|TMDB API|string|
|product_company|company or companies responsible for producing the film|TMDB API|string|
|Month|represents the month a movie was released|Engineered - TMDB|numeric|
|Year|represents the year a movie was released|Engineered - TMDB|numeric|
|budget_adj|ammount of money spent producing a movie (adjusted to 2021 dollars[^1]) |Engineered - TMDB|numeric|
|revenue_adj|ammount of money generated by the movie (adjusted to 2021 dollars[^1]) |Engineered - TMDB|numeric|
|profit_adj|difference between revenue and budget (adjusted to 2021 dollars[^1])|Engineered - TMDB|numeric|
|belongs_to_collection|Represents if a film is part of a series or a stand alone|Engineered - TMDB|boolean|

[^1]: adjustments to the budget, revenue, and profit made based on the [U.S.Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index Inflation Calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm)

"tconst", "genre_id", and "prodco_id" appear aspart of our SQL database as primary/secondary keys and do not appear in our analysis, hypothesis testing, or modeling.

Full data dictionaries, including features not used for our analysis, can befound at [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) and [TMDB's](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-details) respective websites.

### Data Selection
The following choices were made regarding what data to keep or cut for this study:

- Release Year: For our study, we limited the entries in our dataset to movies released from 2000 to 2021. This timeframe was selected to give us a large enough sample size while also not extending so far into the past as to have different tastes/preferences (IE: general preferences were different between the 1970s and now). 
- Genre: Documentaries were removed from the dataset at the request of ourcustomer. Documentaries often differ from traditional ‘entertainment’ films in terms of budget, revenue, ratings, etc which might have changed the shape of our data and impacted our analysis.
- MPAA Rating: Our customer expressed an interest in movies rated G, PG, PG-13, and R, suggesting that unrated/NC-17 movies might be more elicit or less reputable. For this reason, movies that were either unrated or rated NC-17 were excluded from our analysis but were kept in our database for future use. 
- Budget/Revenue: Movies without budget or revenue information were excluded from our analysis but were kept in our database for future use.

### Caveats and Considerations
Entries into TMDB are user generated/crowdsourced which means that we are relying on users to accurately input data on the movies we use in our study. This could be especially problematic for movies that are less popular or more niche. I also was unable to find how TMDB handled financial information for movies that were released straight to video/dvd/streaming which are obviously different than movies released in theaters. 

## Methods
The work for this project was split into multiple Jupyter Notebooks to keepindividual steps and processes distinct and separate. This was done to keepfrom re-running initial steps (ETL, cleaning) and to reduce the code andprocessing time for our analysis notebooks (hypothesis testing). Thegeneral workflow was as follows:
- [Phase 1](https://github.com/msmccann10/PP-movie-database-and-analysis/blob/main/01_Extract_and_Transform.ipynb): Download, inspect, and clean IMDB data. Build an API call for the TMDBdatabase. Retrieve, inspect, and clean TMDB data. Conduct initial EDA.
- [Phase 2](https://github.com/msmccann10/PP-movie-database-and-analysis/blob/main/02_MYSQL_Database_Creation.ipynb): Create MySQL database using IMDB and TMDB data.
- [Phase 5](https://github.com/msmccann10/PP-movie-database-and-analysis/blob/main/03_Hypothesis_Testing.ipynb): Use MySQL database to conduct hypothesis testing. 

## Results – Hypothesis Testing 
### MPAA Rating Effect
Question: Does movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, R) have any affect on the profits it generates?
- Null Hypothesis: MPAA rating does not affect the profit a movie generates.
- Alternative Hypothesis: MPAA does affect the profit a movie generates.
- Alpha: 0.05

### Genre Effect
Question: Do some movie genres make more profit than others?  
- Null Hypothesis: Genre does not affect the profit a movie generates
- Alternative Hypothesis: Genre does affect the profit a movie generates
- Alpha: 0.05

### Runtime Trends
Question: Annecdotaly it feels as if movies have gotten longer... Have movies in fact gotten longer in the past 20 years?
- Null Hypothesis: Movie runtime (length) has not changed significantly since 2000.
- Alternative Hypothesis: Movie runtime (length) has changed significantlysince 2000.
- Alpha: 0.05

### Runtime Effect
Question: Does movie length matter when it comes to the profit of a movie? 
- Null Hypothesis: Move length does not affect the profit a movie generates.
- Alternative Hypothesis: Movie length does affect the profit a moviegenerates.
- Alpha: 0.05
