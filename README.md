## Overview
My customer has requested that I have recommend strategies for making a successful movie based on data available on IMDB and TMDB. To accomplish this task I extracted data from IMDB and TMDB, transformed/cleaned the data, and loaded it into a MySQL database for EDA, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling. 

The primary indicator of success for my analysis is revenue which measures the total amount of income generated by the movie. To conduct my analysis I set out to answer the following questions:
1. Does MPAA rating affect the revenue of a movie? Which ratings perform best/worst?
2. Does genre affect the revenue of a movie? Which genres perform best/worst?
3. Has runtime (in minutes) increased or decreased signficiantly over the past 20 years?
4. Do longer movies do better than shorter movies? 

## Business Problem 
A fictional customer is the newly appointed head of a production company. They want their first movie as the head of their company to be a major success and want to use data to optimize their movie and increase the liklihood of success. Revenue is the primary indicator of success for this analysis.

## Data
### Data Sources
The data for this project comes from two separate sources. These datasets were extracted, transformed, and loaded into a MySQL database for analysis as part of this project. Our data sources are as follows:
- [IMDB's Publically Available Data](https://datasets.imdbws.com/): IMDB provides basic information and statistics on movies within their database from which we can pull a majority of the information needed for our analysis. 
- [TMDB Moive Data](https://www.themoviedb.org/): Accessed through the [tmdbsimple API package](https://github.com/celiao/tmdbsimple) we were able to augment the data available on IMDB with financial information (budget, revenue) and MPAA rating.

The original dataset has been stored in this repository and can be found [here](https://github.com/msmccann10/PP-movie-database-and-analysis/tree/main/data). The data was subsequently turned into a MySQL database for easier access and analysis.

### Data Dictionary

The following features are referential for our MySQL database but will not appear in our analysis, hypothesis testing, or modeling

|Feature|Description|Type|
